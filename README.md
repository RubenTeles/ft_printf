# ft_printf

The ft_printf project is an integral part of the curriculum at the 42 programming school, aiming to recreate the printf function from the standard C library.

In the ft_printf project, I have developed my own version of the printf function in the C programming language, capable of handling various data types and output formats.

The ft_printf function enables formatted data printing in a wide range of formats, including strings, characters, integers, floating-point numbers, and more.

Implemented using advanced concepts of string manipulation, type conversion, output formatting, and variable argument handling, the ft_printf function provides powerful customization for data printing.

Through the ft_printf project, I have enhanced my skills in string manipulation, output formatting, memory management, and variable argument handling in C.

The ft_printf function serves as a robust tool for printing data with personalized formatting and is widely utilized in C programming.
